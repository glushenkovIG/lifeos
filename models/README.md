# LifeOS UML Models

This directory contains the UML schemas and diagrams that represent the core architecture of the LifeOS system.

## Overview of Models

The UML diagrams in this directory aim to visually represent:

1. **Subjective World Model** - How LifeOS represents the internal subjective experience of human consciousness
2. **Attention Systems** - Mechanisms for modeling focus and attention shift in humans
3. **Memory Models** - Representations of different memory types and their interactions
4. **Identity Structures** - How identity and self-concept are modeled
5. **Social Relationships** - Interfaces with Social OS and relationship modeling

## Usage

These UML models serve as the architectural foundation for implementing LifeOS components. They can be used by:

- Developers implementing LifeOS interfaces
- AI researchers mapping human psychological patterns
- Contributors looking to expand the LifeOS ecosystem
- Integration partners connecting to LifeOS APIs

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new models or modifying existing ones:

1. Follow standard UML 2.0+ notation
2. Provide clear documentation of entities and relationships
3. Link to relevant psychological or cognitive science research
4. Ensure compatibility with existing LifeOS architectural principles

## Subjective World Representation System

> Initial concept by Ivan Glushenkov | Started: 28.05.2025

### Overview

LifeOS is a subjective world representation system for computers designed to be compatible with:
- AI-agents
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication
- Identity Delegation Protocol (IDP)
- World OS integration

### Mission

Our main goal is to explain irrational human behavior by modeling:

- Attention maps and focus mechanisms
- SCAR brain task processing
- Internal dialogue patterns
- Memory formation and recall
- Relationship dynamics
- Hierarchical positioning
- Cultural influences
- Goal-setting behaviors
- Dreams and aspirations
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Resource management
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) principles
- Opportunity recognition
- Deal structures
- Time perception
- Emotional intensity mapping
- Past, future, and present integration
- Hero journey frameworks
- Spiritual dimensions
- Evolution patterns toward rational systems

### Theoretical Foundation

The project is initially based on:
- Jordan B. Peterson's research
- Maps of Meaning methodology
- Big 5 personality trait modeling
- Internal dialogue mapping
- Value structure hierarchies
- Life-long games with life-long partners theory

Our aim is to eventually teach AI systems to assist humans across all life dimensions:
- Individual development
- Group dynamics
- City-level interactions
- Nation-wide societal patterns

## Core Components

### Identity Delegation Protocol (IDP)

The Identity Delegation Protocol enables secure, transparent, and controlled delegation of identity aspects to AI systems and other entities. Key features include:

- **Identity Representation**: Digital representation of human identity aspects (preferences, values, knowledge)
- **Delegation Framework**: Explicit controls and contextual delegation boundaries
- **Trust and Verification**: Verification of delegate behaviors against delegator intent
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Improved delegation through iterative learning
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Coordination between multiple delegates representing the same identity

### Hypersocial System

The Hypersocial component (now called Social OS) models and facilitates the social aspects of human life, including:

- **Social Network Modeling**: Maps relationships between individuals, groups, and institutions
- **Social Capital Management**: Tracks accumulation of trust, reputation, and influence
- **Cultural Context Integration**: Models cultural norms, values, and expectations
- **Group Dynamics**: Models formation, maintenance, and dissolution of groups
- **Communication Patterns**: Maps communication networks and information flow
- **Collective Intelligence**: Facilitates group problem-solving and decision-making

### LifeOS UML Models

The UML models represent:

- **Subjective World Model**: Internal subjective experience of human consciousness
- **Attention Systems**: Mechanisms for modeling focus and attention shift
- **Memory Models**: Representations of different memory types and their interactions
- **Identity Structures**: Identity and self-concept modeling
- **Social Relationships**: Interfaces with Social OS and relationship modeling
- **Cultural & Value Systems**: Models cultural influences and personal values
- **Life Management**: Goals, conflicts, resources, and relationship management
- **Temporal & Narrative**: Time perception, intensity, journey frameworks, and spirituality
- **Evolution**: Progress toward more rational systems

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core System Architecture & Documentation
   - Define UML schemas for all components
   - Establish theoretical foundations
   - Document core concepts

2. **Phase 2**: Interface Development
   - Build API specifications
   - Develop integration points
   - Create reference implementations

3. **Phase 3**: Application Development
   - Build proof-of-concept applications
   - Demonstrate practical use cases
   - Expand ecosystem with partner technologies

4. **Phase 4**: Advanced Integration
   - WorldOS compatibility
   - Social OS connectivity
   - AI agent ecosystem expansion
   - World interface integration

## Project Goals

1. Create a comprehensive UML schema describing human aspects
2. Establish compatibility with the WorldOS ecosystem
3. Build interfaces for AI systems to understand human subjectivity
4. Develop practical applications for personal and social growth

## Related Systems

**Social OS** (previously called "Hypersocial") is maintained as a separate repository that focuses exclusively on social interaction aspects. LifeOS interfaces with Social OS but maintains distinct functionality.

**IDP** (Identity Delegation Protocol) provides the authentication and identity management framework used by LifeOS.
